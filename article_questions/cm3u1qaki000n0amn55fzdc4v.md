### 1. What is Hashnode Docs?
A few months ago, Hashnode launched a new app called "Docs", and I decided to move the documentation of one of my open-source projects to Hashnode.

### 2. Why did you decide to move your documentation to Hashnode Docs?
Working with it is as simple as writing blogs on Hashnode but in an organized way. I decided to write my fresh experience of using Docs for a public open-source tool.

### 3. What are some concerns you have about Hashnode Docs?
I’m feeling a few concerns about Hashnode Docs. The main reason is that I’m separating the documentation from my codebase and hosting it elsewhere.

### 4. What is the main reason for separating the documentation from the codebase?
It's like a double-edged sword. You can modify and deploy it very quickly, but only your team has access to the docs, and not everyone can contribute to it.

### 5. What feature is coming to GitHub that might address your concerns?
There is a "GitHub" feature that will be available soon, but I don't think it will be the same as keeping the documentation within the scope of the project itself.

### 6. What did you like about MkDocs Material?
I moved my documentation from [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), which was highly customizable. It offered many plugins and extensions, and you could modify existing features, which was really nice.

### 7. What options are missing in Hashnode Docs?
I haven't seen these options on Hashnode. Remember, Hashnode Docs *isn't just for developers*. In my view, it's designed to let you document anything, regardless of the level of programming knowledge.

### 8. What is lacking in the code highlighting feature of Hashnode Docs?
The syntax highlighting feature is somewhat lacking, as it doesn't recognize all the keywords in some languages, which can be frustrating at first.

### 9. How do you feel about the code snippets in Hashnode Docs?
I strongly feel that code snippets haven't changed much since the first release of Hashnode, and Hashnode Docs is still using the same setup.

### 10. What is another issue you have with Hashnode Docs?
Including badges is another issue with Docs. I wish I could add some [Shields.io](https://shields.io/) badges to my docs to show the current status of my project.

### 11. What is missing in terms of features in Hashnode Docs?
There is no recovery feature yet. If you delete any part of your document, you can't retrieve it back. Tagging and versioning in documents are very important features.

### 12. What is another feature missing in Hashnode Docs?
If you want to translate your docs into another language, there is currently no feature available for that.

### 13. What do you like about Hashnode Docs?
There are many features that help you present your docs effectively. You can use `/steps`, `/card`, `/accordion`, `/tabs`, and even `/button` to customize your docs and make the reading experience more engaging.

### 14. What is a benefit of using Hashnode Docs?
You don't need a CI pipeline to deploy your documentation after each change, which allows for continuous publication—this is fantastic.

### 15. Why is Hashnode Docs a good choice for open-source projects?
If you're looking for a platform to publish the documentation for your open-source project, Hashnode Docs is a great choice. It includes features that read various parameters from the GitHub repository you specify, such as the number of stars your repository has.
