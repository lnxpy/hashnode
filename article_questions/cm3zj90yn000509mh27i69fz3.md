### How does Notio work with Hashnode?
Notio functions as a GitHub CI pipeline (GitHub Action) that connects to a Hypermode GraphQL instance and processes the article by making API calls to the instance.

### What is the purpose of the Hypermode GraphQL instance in Notio?
The Hypermode GraphQL instance is used by Notio to process the article and perform tasks such as translation, question generation, abstraction, and simplification.

### What is the benefit of using Notio for post-publication LLM work?
Notio allows you to generate different versions of an article, including translations, questions, summaries, and simplified versions, which can be published on Hashnode.

### How does Notio generate questions about an article?
Notio uses the Hypermode GraphQL instance to generate questions about the article based on the configuration provided.

### What is the purpose of the `question-generation` method in Notio?
The `question-generation` method allows you to generate a specified number of questions about the article, with or without answers, and save them as a markdown document.

### How does Notio simplify an article?
Notio uses the Hypermode GraphQL instance to simplify the article by removing code blocks and lighter discussion topics, while still covering all sections of the article.

### What is the purpose of the `simplify-article` method in Notio?
The `simplify-article` method allows you to create a simpler version of the article for readers who need a basic understanding of the topic.

### How do I set up Notio for my Hashnode blog?
To set up Notio, you need to enable blog backup from Hashnode, create a Hypermode instance, retrieve the endpoint URL and API key, store the secrets in the backup repository, and create a workflow file in the repository.

### What is the purpose of the `HYPERMODE_ENDPOINT_URL` and `HYPERMODE_API_TOKEN` secrets in Notio?
The `HYPERMODE_ENDPOINT_URL` and `HYPERMODE_API_TOKEN` secrets are used to authenticate with the Hypermode GraphQL instance and perform tasks such as translation, question generation, abstraction, and simplification.

### How do I use the `question-generation` method in Notio?
To use the `question-generation` method, you need to add a step to the `notio-ci.yml` file with the following configuration:
```yaml
- name: Running Notio
  uses: lnxpy/notio@main
  with:
    method: generate-questions
    path: questions/
    question_limit: 10
    include_answers: false
    hypermode_endpoint: ${{ secrets.HYPERMODE_ENDPOINT }}
    hypermode_api_token: ${{ secrets.HYPERMODE_API_TOKEN }}
```
### What is the purpose of the `Commiting` step in Notio?
The `Commiting` step is used to commit the generated articles to the repository and make them visible to your audiences.

### What is the purpose of the `notio-ci.yml` file in Notio?
The `notio-ci.yml` file is used to configure the GitHub CI pipeline and specify the tasks to be performed by Notio, such as translation, question generation, abstraction, and simplification.
