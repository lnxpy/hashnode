## PasteMe - Paste Codes From Your Terminal

### Introduction
**PasteMe** is a modern open-source RESTful pastebin service that allows users to paste their source codes, snippets, and code blocks right from their command-line interfaces and terminals!

> Legends claimed that this project is developed from space! So let's find out.

- [Check out PasteMe; deployed on PythonAnywhere services](https://pasteme.pythonanywhere.com)!

#### The point where all things began..
I personally was familiar with [pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin) services. Since I'm so into those black and dark interfaces and CLIs, I needed a piece of software that enables me to share my programming bugs, issues, or even gold code pieces with others in the community. I found some packages but I was looking for something fancier with more options until Hashnode announced an extraordinary Hackathon partnering with [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) and that made me open a new fresh terminal tab immediately and run `$ git init` and start developing my idea named "PasteMe"!

#### Paste me up there..
As developers, we are always developing a system full of architectures, components, and dependencies. It's so common we run into issues and problems during worktime. There's been a lot of times when I was stuck in making a function work perfectly but the key to that perfectness was in another configuration file from another module in a package. That being said, sometimes after hours of boring work time and struggling with fixing my bugs, my buggy source codes were whispering to me like "*Paste me Sadra..please.. do it.. Paste me up there..*" which brings us to PasteMe!

### 1. Features
There is a well-structured RESTful service behind PasteMe which allows users to paste their snippets and code blocks to the powerful PlanetScale databases by using `pasteme-cli` package. The endpoints are designed responsively, meaning all developers from other platforms can build their own tools and interact with PasteMe's APIs in their products.

#### 1.1. PasteMe webservice
- Dynamic section showing the PyPI package statistics and GitHub repos' stars.
- Showing the pasted source codes in popular light and dark themes + line number.
- An [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) cast player showing the setup process and how you can start using PasteMe.
- A perfect auto-generated API documentation for developers.
- A minimal weblog.

#### 1.2. `pasteme-cli` Python package (SDK)
- Available for Windows and Linux distributions.
- Minimum dependency.
- Easy to set up and use.
- Accessible from your CLIs and within your Python projects as a package.

### 2. Start Pasting
In order to use PasteMe, simply install the `pasteme-cli` package via either [pip package manager](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) or by building the package source and dive through the codes.

Run the following command and make this package available on your machine.

```sh
$ pip install pasteme-cli
...
$ pasteme --help
```

| **Option** 	|  **Long**  	|  **Default**  	|             **Description**             	|
|:----------:	|:----------:	|:-------------:	|:---------------------------------------:	|
|   **-t**   	|   --title  	|   "Untitled"  	|               Paste Title               	|
|   **-l**   	| --language 	|   PlainText   	|  Source code language for highlighting  	|
|   **-T**   	|   --theme  	| Default Light 	|               Paste theme               	|
|   **-s**   	|   --start  	|   first line  	| Source code starting line	|
|   **-e**   	|    --end   	|   last line   	| Source code ending line      |
|   **-v**   	|  --verbose 	|     False     	|               More details              	|
|   **-h**   	|   --help   	|       -       	|               Help command              	|

Imagine I have a Python function in my `program.py` that doesn't print out the greetings message for some reason. Let's paste it and share it.

```python
def hello_world(name):
    return f'Hello {name}. How are you today?!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    name = input('Your name: ')
    hello_world(name)
```

I open a new terminal/cmd tab. Since I'm an Atom (A popular text editor) fan, I want to paste it with the `atom one dark` theme.

```shell
$ pasteme -t "My hello_world() doesn't show the message!!" -l python -T atom-one-dark program.py
PASTE --> https://pasteme.pythonanywhere.com/paste/2425b
$
```

Right after running that command, I can see the URL to my paste. Let's browse it.

And volla!

Now, I want to paste everything inside the `if` statement only. I simply use `-s` (or `--start`) for this purpose. (Use `-e` to specify the ending line)

```shell
$ pasteme ... -s 5 program.py
```

### 4. PyPI & GitHub Integrations
The **Py**thon **P**ackage **I**ndex, abbreviated as [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), is the official third-party software repository for Python. This is where `pasteme-cli` is archived as well. By checking the [home page of PasteMe](https://pasteme.pythonanywhere.com), you'll notice the following section.

![image (2).png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658497433854/gRLtBx3Qp.png align="center")

There is a model called `Statistic` in `pypi` application of the project which is responsible for storing all statistics gathered from api.github.com and https://pypistats.org/api. Therefore, I designed a scheduled task that runs a [custom command](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/custom-management-commands/) every day at a specific time and that command actually updates the `Statistic` model by creating a new record to the table based on the information responded from the endpoints.

### 5. Technologies Used in PasteMe
In this section, we're going to talk about the tools and frameworks that I used to build up PasteMe.

#### 5.1. Frameworks & Tools
- Django Framework (Python back-end framework) + DRF
- Bootstrap Framework (Integrated with Django's template engine)
- [Pylibrary Cookiecutter](https://github.com/ionelmc/cookiecutter-pylibrary) (to develop the `pasteme-cli` Python package)

#### 5.2. Infrastructures
  - Deployed on [PythonAnywhere](https://pythonanywhere.com) ([Check out PasteMe Live!](https://pasteme.pythonanywhere.com))
  - Database is powered by [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com)

### Development
Both the package and web service have tests that make the development process way easier with a lower risk of failure. Keep up with the README/CONTRIBUTING docs and make your way towards the contribution.

[Check out PasteMe's readme](https://github.com/collove/pasteme#service-installation) document for a complete local installation guide. You can also connect your locally cloned PasteMe to a PlanetScale FREE database by following the guide as well.
