# Tips for Writing Stunning Tech Articles!

In this non-technical blog post, I'm going to talk about some tips that help you towards better impressions and engagement on your next technical articles. Speaking of technicalness, I mean pieces that are technically written and structured about fields or sub-fields of Computer Engineering and Software Development more specifically.

### 1\. Choose Hot Trending Topics

That got to be so obvious that many people desire to follow the most up-to-date content every time they check on their phones. Since a subject/technology is new, there are fewer viewpoints about that meaning its audiences are always open to any content and informative thoughts about it. Thus, if you bring up realistic theories or have a brilliant look and point of view about it, well, then *a few birds and one rock*.

Hunting hot topics require you to be always up-to-date and well-informed about the tech companies, and their projects. That's how you always have something to write up about.

### 2\. Write In Simple Precise Words

An article being technical *does not* justify that you should be using complicated expressions and words to explain the subject. Quite the contrary, as your article gets more precise and clear, your audiences would be more eager to follow.

Technical articles can contain complicated concepts and terminology, so using simple language will help readers comprehend the material better. Simple language also helps to ensure that the article is accessible to a wider audience, as readers with less technical knowledge will be able to understand the content.

Please do keep in mind that Simplicity is the most crucial key. Leave your audiences to deal with the concepts, not the words.

### 3\. Titles Matter

Choosing the right title for your articles is another key point that readers notice in the first place. Titles even decide whether your writing is worthy of checking.

Titles are great terms for sparking curiosity among audiences so by checking some considerations, you won't make any mistakes in writing titles for your blog posts.

Eventually, your titles should be conveniently impressive. Check the following bullet points. They will give you a better view of the attributes of a good title.

A good title should be..

* Alphabetically capitalized.
    
* Short and concise.
    
* Made up of keywords.
    
* Straight to the point.
    
* Self-explanatory.
    

Here are some examples of bad titles and their refactored versions.

| ❌ Bad Titles | ✅ Better Titles |
| --- | --- |
| How to start using Python | Introduction to Python |
| What is the difference between a Coder and a Programmer | Coder vs. Programmer |
| Day 023 of 100 coding challenge | Coding Challenge: Day 23 |
| Flexbox | Discover Flexbox in CSS |

Some subjects may need multiple articles. Although I never suggest you follow such a continuous procedure, you better explain the same subject in two articles or three.

Choose a proper constant prefix phrase for showing the relation between the articles and try grouping them together if possible. Check the following example.

* *Introduction to Django Models:* Part 1
    
* *Introduction to Django Models:* Part 2
    
* *Introduction to Django Models:* Part 3
    

### 4\. Structure Your Article

Always start your articles with a short tiny introduction in a paragraph or two. It should cover a brief overview of the topic. Using "TL;DR" is another smart move for technical articles.

Sectionize your article into different parts. If your article requires some prerequisites, try explaining them in the first sections or bring up some references instead.

Ending up your articles with a "Conclusion" section allows the readers to review the sections they've learned once again. It's better to keep it short and concise and in a reminding style for the audience. Some people tend to read the Conclusion section first in order to get what has happened through the sections. (It happens due to the weak quality of the introductions)

### 5\. Always Have Examples

Speaking of technical articles in Computer Science fields, including examples massively helps to make the articles more persuasive, as readers can see the practical implications of the points being made.

Additionally, bringing examples into the sections allows readers to understand the functionalities in an easier way and it improves the clarification of each implementation. Generally, showing examples in the style of code blocks is so effective.

### 6\. Visualization

People learn in different ways. A major group of people prefers to learn via images and visualizations. Another group tends to study a subject either through audio or by reading texts.

Visual media in technical articles can be beneficial for the first group in numerous ways. Visual media can help to explain complex concepts in a more easily understandable way.

For example, diagrams, figures, and GIFs can be used to explain the mechanisms. Furthermore, visual media can help to engage readers, making the article more interesting and memorable.
