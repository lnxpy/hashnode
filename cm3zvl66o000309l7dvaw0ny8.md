GitHub offers workflow templates for a variety of languages and tooling. When you set up workflows in your repository, GitHub analyzes the code in your repository and recommends workflows based on the language and framework in your repository. For example, if you use Node.js, GitHub will suggest a workflow template file that installs your Node.js packages and runs your tests. You can search and filter to find relevant workflow templates.
